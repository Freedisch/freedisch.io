I'm a graduate from [African Leadership University](https://www.alueducation.com/), majoring in Software Engineering. Currently, I'm working on a security operations validation platform (APT groups, ransomware, phishing attempts) as a Software Engineer at [TrustStamp](https://truststamp.ai/). I'm an open source addict and have been part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/projects/vFuhwP9m) working on SecureCodeBox, an open-source framework for automated vulnerability scanning in Kubernetes environments supervised by [Jannik Hollenbach](https://github.com/j12934). Besides, I also conducted research on during my bachelor thesis on "Enhancing Crisis Response through Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for understaffed
Emergency Centers in TOGO", supervised by Mr. [Marvin Ogore](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hebWLwEAAAAJ&hl=en) and Ms. [Samiratu Ntohsi](https://rw.linkedin.com/in/samiratu-ntohsi-320580140). If you're interested in working with me or need any career advice feel free to hit me up.

## Research Vision

My long-term research vision is to leverage my interests in distributed systems and machine learning to enhance existing healthcare infrastructure, building sustainable solutions specifically tailored for low-income countries facing data scarcity. I believe this will help cope with the shortages of medical workers.
